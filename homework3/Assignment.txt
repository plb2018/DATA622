this  assignment you do not have to write any R script.

No programming but function as a senior data scientist.

here is some background:

You hired Kansales Ruffio as a summer intern in winter for his ML and R hacking skills.

You asked him to analyze a dataset from the internet. You provided him a training and test data partitions.

KR bolted for 2/3 weeks showing up in his cubicle after 3 PM and working until you arrived in the office

at 7 AM. Then, Ruffio showed up at 8 AM with an email to you saying he analyzed the dataset

using several algorithms consistent with both No Free Lunch theorem and Occam's Razor.

He claims you can simply source the R script which will create two files with confusion matrices

and performance measures for classifiers.

As his mentor and guide,

1) you can  provide feedback how he can improve his approach to  data science.

2) You may also identify and justify the choice of classifiers Ruffio ran to complete this task.

3) You can compare the performance metrics of classifiers and provide an explanation for the observed performance variances.

Ruffio can be given a pass grade if the script can be sourced free of errors.

There are five files attached

vglm_lda_script.txt is R script you can run on IBM without any modification

the two output files that script generates

and two data files for training and testing that Ruffio used.

You do not have to do any work on IBM Cloud you can run without lifting a finger 

But as per agreement I have uploaded it here -- now you have to make sure paths are

consistent. 

I will be reviewing the R code during the next two weeks during meetups

while you will be analyzing the output

and explaining the performance based on the kind of classifier used.

Thank you
